# NestJS GCP Structured Logging POC
## Description

A proof-of-concept implementation showcasing structured logging from NestJS to Google Cloud Platform using Winston. This solution provides correlatedIds, structured logs GraphQL APIs with minimal configuration.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

â€¢ Structured Logging: JSON-formatted logs that are easily searchable and parsable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
â€¢ Correlation IDs: Track requests across your application with unique identifiers

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Notable packages

```bash
# Main dependency for structured logging and creating guids for correlationIDs
npm install winston @google-cloud/logging-winston uuid
```

## Environment Variables

The logging behavior can be customized with the following environment variables:

â€¢ NODE_ENV: Set to production for GCP-optimized logging
